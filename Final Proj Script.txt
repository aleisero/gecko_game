Gecko Game


Is it a narrative game? Is it a visual novel? Is it a point and click adventure? Is it a short PCG lizard having simulation/experience?
who knows.


Basic Framework:
* Game starts. Title screen
* Play →  intro narrative screen 
* Point and click adventure with a sassy narrator and gecko shenanigans
* The end




Script:


BG info [appearing one phrase at a time with a next button between sections]
At last, the day has come … after all this time, you’re finally fulfilling your wildest wishes … your deepest dreams … your darkest desires ….! Yes, that’s right: you’re buying a gecko.


[Pet shop BG appears


Choose a lizard!


...actually, looks like they only have one kind of lizard available today…


It’s a Chinese Cave Gecko!


Good choice.


[3 gecko options: leopard gecko, crested gecko, chinese cave gecko
[whether the user can pick any will depend on the narrative? If not implemented options not allowed will get the dialogue: They’re out of stock of that kind of gecko.]


After lizard chosen:
Alright, time to choose a name for your new little buddy. Hmmm….


Oh? You already chose one? What a good name!


Now choose some items to care for your new gecko.


[3 options - PCG names]
[if i implement it the user could also reject these names and type in whatever name they want]
[there can be multiple versions of the following dialogue that are randomly selected if i wanna really play with PCG instead of focusing on making this a game]
What a great name for sweet little [lizard-name]. Fits perfectly. Alright, now to pick out everything we need for the tank.


[player can pick and choose however many of the following items as they want. Different item combos can lead to different endings:] 


* Hide [important]
* Water dish
* Fake plant
* Branch
* Rock
* Crickets [important]
* Calcium powder
* Paper towels
* Heat lamp
* Spray bottle


[player clicks and drags these items into an inventory. Would an inventory system be too hard to make?? We’ll see. If not, they just choose them…]
[when player clicks “check out”, it fades/transitions to home, tank view, empty]


[player clicks and drags items from inventory into tank; depending on how many they have, different dialogue options follow


[if the player only bought one item, even if it is a hide:
You idiot, you think your lizard’s gonna like that barran tank? Where’s the intrigue? The mystery? Everything’s on display! This is no good. No good at all. Clearly, you lack the decision making powers necessary to own a living thing.
[you can still put your lizard in


[if the player bought multiple things and no hide:
You call that a home?? There’s no bedroom. There’s no bathroom. There’s nowhere to sleep! This is a scandal. I’m not letting you put your new lizard in that shamble of a tank.
[you can anyway
[if so you can see the lizard in the tank and click on it/talk to it immediately


[if the player bought any combo that includes a hide and crickets]
Ah, now there’s an acceptable lizard home. Alright, now let’s get your lizard acquainted with their new space.


[if the player bought everything:]
How beautiful! Wonderful! Any gecko would be lucky to live in this tank. In fact, any number of species would be. Are you renting? No? Well then… let’s get your lizard acquainted with their new home.


[if the player gets through this part they can now place their lizard in the tank by clicking and dragging it from the inventory to the tank. At this time the crickets are greyed out and cannot be selected.]
[animation of the player putting the lizard in the tank]
[lizard immediately scurries into the hide]


Ah, a shy one, huh? 


[crickets are no longer greyed out, gecko no longer in inventory. only action the player now has is to click and drag the crickets into the tank]
[i guess they could also try dragging anything else they have in their inventory that didnt go into the tank, IE paper towel roll, calcium powder.]
[animation of player doing whatever it is the user chooses. IE:


[player clicks and drags calcium powder directly to the tank:
Now what do you expect that to do? Think [lizard-name] is just gonna lick that up off the floor?


[player clicks and drags crickets into tank:
That’ll keep your new lizard full!


[player clicks and drags crickets into tank and then later drags calcium to tank
Yum, calcium crickets.


[player clicks and drags paper towels into tank:
There’s already paper towels lining the bottom. I guess you could double the layer, but doesn’t seem worth it, does it….?


[clicks and drags spray bottle to tank:
[no dialogue, just spray animation 


[eventually if the player clicks around the tank that also spurs new dialogues


[plants
Yeup, fake plants. Work like a charm.


[rock
A nice sunny spot.


[branch
Good for climbing on!


[heat lamp
Gotta stay toasty warm when you’re cold-blooded, huh?


[hide
Yeah, [lizard-name] is in there, alright.


[hide x2
Your lizard is nocturnal. It’s asleep, you dumbass.


[hide x3
You’re really gonna keep poking at it?


[hide x4
Come on, leave [lizard-name] be already.


[hide x5
[lizard finally looks out, glaring
Oh, wonderful. You’ve made it mad.


[lizard
[player scoops up lizard
Woah, woah, hey, we’re not ready for that -- 


Lizard:
Narrator, shut up, will you? You’re more obnoxious than they are. 


Narrator: 
Okay, alright… Clearly I’m not wanted nor respected here. *door slam noise*


[[[endings:
[[all endings final narrative cards are accompanied by a relevant illustration


[good end: player bought the hide and fed the lizard crickets


Lizard: Sorry about the glare. That’s just how I look in the dead of night, but since it’s you I can make an exception. [expression changes to something happier]


Lizard: I mean after all, this place is pretty cushy, huh? And the all-you-can-eat buffet is included!


Lizard: Mmmm, crickets.


Lizard: I think this is gonna be pretty cool. 


You put your lizard back in the tank and he retreats into the hide to get some more sleep. You then enjoy the rest of your mutually beneficial lizard and lizard-owner relationship!


~~


[okay end: player bought hide, didn’t feed lizard


Lizard: So I know you’re pretty new at this, but listen.


Lizard: This tank’s a home. A shiny, brand new home. The countertops and tile all shine. But you open up the refrigerator and it’s totally empty. 


Lizard: So what I’m telling you is you need to high-tail it to the grocery store. Pick up some chops, yeah? A few snacks? Maybe do some meal prep when you get back?


Lizard: I mean, it’s up to you. But if you don’t, you can’t expect me to stick around. That’s all I’m saying.


You’ve been threatened but you have another chance. You buy your lizard some crickets and spend your days in quiet, isolated fear.


~~


[bad end: player didn’t buy hide; potentially clicked on lizard immediately


Lizard: Listen, you probably mean well, but this is no kinda home for a guy like me.


Lizard: You expect me to sit there and let you stare at me at all hours?


Lizard: That’s like being in a zoo, you know.


Lizard: I wouldn’t call that comfortable.


Lizard: Maybe you should try it. [glare gets even MORE EVIL].


You get shoved into a human-sized tank to get stared at 24/7. A taste of your own medicine.


~~
[band ending
[i have no idea how you get this band ending…,,,, probably an easter egg, or maybe you can buy a lizard-sized instrument at the petshop and if you do something specific it’ll take you to this ending
[but they also have to have the hide/do the multiple clicks to get the lizard to come out thing for this one


Lizard: That rhythmic tapping….


Lizard: Hey, are you a drummer?


Lizard: You are? That’s great! Listen, I’ve been looking for a drummer for ages… wanna join my alternative rock garage punk lizard band?


Lizard: Don’t worry that you’re not a drummer. You can play a lizard-sized drum set anyways. It’ll be great!


You and your new lizard form a band with some of the other, un-adopted lizards from the pet shop! Your music takes off with your lizard as the band’s front man.


Congratulations, you’re going on a world tour!!!!
